-- The Story of MyTVScheduler

Background:
    I decided to make this app as my entry to Android. I got fed up of constantly forgetting which episode of which season of which program I am watching.
    So here it is..

Early Stages (January):
    Development started early in 2017. I started on the barebones of the app, where the searching happened in the background and the first CardView was created. That's it.
    Then Uni exams started, then the second semester... 

Rebirth (May):
    Wednesday 17th May came around as did Google I/O. During their Keynote, they announced official support for a language that I'd nver heard of before called Kotlin.
    To take breaks from revision, I decided to convert all current Java code into Kotlin. Let me just say, I love Kotlin so far. It's SO much more intuitive, clean and forgiving than Java.

Ramping Up (June):
    Exams are over; I am free until September!!

    I really dived into Kotlin, loving every minute of it.

    Then when running the app, I was getting a weird error message. The API stopped working (They introduced a paid model -.-). So then it was research time.
    I found TheMovieDB which has a great free model, but I disgress (see for youself in the apks)

    Development was flying, features being added constantly. Although not yet pretty, the app was starting to work as imagined.

    Then we hit the first major milestone.. 

Timeline:

    - January 2017: The journey begins.
    - 17th May 2017: The app is reborn in Kotlin.

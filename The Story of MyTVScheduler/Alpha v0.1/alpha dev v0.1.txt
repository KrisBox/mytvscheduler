---- MyTVScheduler Alpha v0.1 

The First Major Milestone

This very first version marks the first milestone for the app. It is actually usable if you excuse the lack of UI intuition.

The feature list for v0.1:

    - You can search for an episode using key words ('Game' for Game of Thrones eg).
    - You can select a program from your search to see the program information.
    - You can see the overview, average rating, poster, and each episode that exists for the program.
    - You can mark any episode as watched and the program will remember this forever.
    - Each season is shown in tabs with each episode shown underneath.
    - There is a navigation drawer, which does not yet work.
    - The very beginnings of caching and offline use.

What will be milestone v0.2?

    - Caching and offline use will be fully implemented.
    - You will be able to set a whole season as watched.
    - The navigation drawer will lead you to empty lands.
    - The episode list will be full page scrollable, instead of just a tiny area.

Bon Apple Tea.
